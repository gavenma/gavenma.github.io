Hi, my name is Ziye Ma (马梓业), and I'm currently a PhD candidate at the EECS department of UC Berkeley. I'm also known as Gaven, so feel free to call me whichever way you prefer. I'm gracisouly supervised by [Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/) and I also collaborate with Prof [Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu). I was born in the city of Beijing, and I spent most of my early life jumping back and forth between Beijing and Toronto. I studied Engineering Science at the University of Toronto as an undergraduate student and majored in Robotics Engineering. After that, I continued my study as a PhD student here at UC Berkeley. I was an undergraduate researcher at the [STARS lab](https://starslab.ca) under the supervision of Prof [Jonathan Kelly](http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/) and worked on cool projects regarding robust estimation in robotics.

Research Interest
======
My research interests broadly lie in the field of mathmatical optimization, machine learning, and nonconvexity. To be more specific, I'm interested in solving nonconvex problems globally, either through convexification or global certificates. Currently I'm focused on low rank matrix recovery problems and hope to better understand the conditions under which the problem can be solved with guarantee. I have also worked on projects reagarding the certification of robustness of neural networks. If you have any questions/concerns/suggestions regarding my research, feel free to reach out to me via email and I'll do my best to respond. 

Fun Facts
======
I enjoy photography, watching Anime, and experiencing a city by walking around. Photo credits to my Mom, the shot was taken on 万春亭 of 景山公园 in May of 2021, and in the background is the breathtaking Forbidden City.
